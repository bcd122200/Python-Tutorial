    "# Practice Problem 1\n",
    "Your job is to make a spell checker. You are provided a dictionary of words in the words_10pt.txt file, and an input of words to test in the input_words.txt file. Your output reflect what is present in the output file, problem1_output.txt. The spell checker should check if the word is spelled correctly or if there are possible mispellings by dropping one letter from the word, swapping two letters in the word, or replacing a letter with a new letter from the alphabet. The program should keep track of all mispellings and/or if the word is spelled correctly, output each tested word with the type of mispellings and all words found with that type of mispelling. Your output should be sent to an output text file and not printed to the screen. I would recommend implementing the functions below to arrive at a solution. Note that you should give the functions parameters to use. "
