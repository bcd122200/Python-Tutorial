If we want to specify the b argument and leave the a as it's default, then we can do so like in the third call by specifying which value we are setting. Of course we can do this will all the arguments like in the fourth call.We also don't need to specify any of them if they all have default values.

It works off the principle that if you have x values that are below and above a zero, then the product of their y values will be negative. Consider y=x. If your lower and upper bounds are -1 and 2. The product of their y values -1 * 2 = -2 is negative. This means that between the two values you cross the x-axis at a zero. The bisection method bisects the lower and upper bounds repeatedly to reduce the size of the lower and upper bounds until some condition is met. There are three conditions used:\n",
