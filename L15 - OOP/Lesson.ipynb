    "Woah, lot going on there. What's ______init__ and self? ______init__ is a special function that gets called every time a new instance of Point2D is created (i.e. It gets called by default on line 6). It takes at least 1 parameter, self (we'll come back to that), but in this case it takes 3. x0 and y0 are parameters that are used to assign the input arguments to the objects x and y attributes as seen on lines 3 & 4. So when line 6 is executed, the ______init__ function is called, x0 becomes 2.4, y0 becomes 8.1, and the object we call variable p gets two attributes: x given the value of 2.4 and y given the value of 8.1. We can tell that ______init__ is a special function by the two underscores on either side of the name. We will see some other special functions later and learn more about them. \n",

When you are created, some all-knowing user gives you the values 2.4 and 8.1 and says, \"Hey there little fella, these should be your x and y values. Don't forget them!\" In order for you to remember them, you have to explicitly say that they are yours. So on line 3 you say, that x value is __*my*__ x value. And on line 4 you say, that y value is __*my*__ y value. Without the keyword self, the Point2D object p has no way of claiming the x and y values for himself."
